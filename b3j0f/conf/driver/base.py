"""Module of configuration drivers.

A configuration driver resolve a configuration path with conf resources paths.

A conf path is a configuration path understandable by several drivers.
A resource path is a configuration path understandable only by one type of
driver (and all its sub types of course...).

In order to implement your self drivers, you have to implement those methods:

- rscpaths(path): get resource paths from one configuration path.
- _getconf(rscpath, logger): get one configuration from one resource path.
- _setconf(rscpath, logger): put one configuration from one resource path.
